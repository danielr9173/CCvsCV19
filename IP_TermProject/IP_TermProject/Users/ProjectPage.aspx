            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project was created due to the shocking shortages of personal protective equipment for medical workers that are working with patients with COVID-19.
                Our local hospitals are the most important place to keep save from the fight against this ever growing pandemic. This project will hopefully make changes
                to the rate in which medical workers are getting infected. If we don't act now, it will get out of hand and our county will in serious living conditions.
                So please we need to come together and make this happen so that we can overcome this pandemic.
            </p>

            <h2>Longterm Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Given the nature of COVID-19, there will possibly be a need for PPE in our community far into the future.
                The best course of action is to team up with a local business and start using injection molds so they can continue to serve our area.
                Since injection molds are far more cost effective it is best to move to that at some point after getting as much donations as possible.
